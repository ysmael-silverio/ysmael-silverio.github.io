          <p class="answers">Back when I was still a starting audio technician, I used to do hours and hours of work just because I wanted to learn and wanted to earn the money at the same time. I wouldn’t mind doing extra long hours every day just so that I can earn more and learn more. 
            A day came where I had to stay the night at work because I finished at 2am and had to be back to work at 6am to setup and operate an event. It was a big event for a big company as it was a launch of their new product, so everything needed to be perfect. Me thinking that I have learned a lot already went in and did the setup until we realized that I forgot to bring lots of important things to run the event. 
            Event happened and failures over failures happened during the show. Obviously, the client was not happy with how it all turned out and my former boss received a massive email of complaints of how badly I handled the situation. 
            I apologized and admitted that I did not prepare myself properly and did not check everything that needs to be in the event. That experience has led me to improve my work and humble myself so that it would never happen again. Truly enough, I was able to perform better, and my former boss has put his trust in me that I can run things without worries and had given me opportunities to handle high profile jobs.

          <h3 class="questions"><strong><u>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</u></strong></h3>
          <p class="answers">I was born and raised in the Philippines. Since childhood, my parents and my grandparents have taught me to always humble myself and to respect anyone I encounter. My culture values hard work and perseverance, so I have always practiced those whenever I do something. I believe that putting your heart into something will always give you the best results that’s why I am proud and happy that I was raised with such values by my parents and grandparents.</p>

      <p class="answers">There was this one time a few months ago where I had to do an outdoor movie event in Ngaruawahia. I have prepared for the worst (or so I thought) since if I forgot something, it would be a bit problem since Auckland is hours away. 
        I arrived in the venue, started setting up my equipment, and then that’s when I realized that I grabbed the wrong cable… and it was the most important part of the setup.
        I searched my case if I really had it or not just to find out that I really did not have it. Second course of action I did was to ring the nearest AV shops I could find in the area, but I was out of luck as they were just about to close, and I was still 20 minutes away. Then I decided that I have to make something up. I ended up cutting up another cable and joined it to another to make up the cable configuration I needed. Problem was solved, event happened, and clients were happy.
