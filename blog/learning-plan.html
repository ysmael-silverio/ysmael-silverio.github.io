      <h2 class="questions"><strong><u>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</u></strong></h2>
      <p class="answers">My long-term plan is to be able to work as a full stack developer being able to deliver the best of my abilities. 
        Also to try and find a job that will allow me to work remotely as I want to be able to travel or visit my family 
        overseas and still keep working at the same time.
        Will probably keep studying other sides of the tech industry.
